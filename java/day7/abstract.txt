abstract keyword

if all the subclasses have provided seperate implementation for the method in superclass, then superclass method  implementation is not significant. also implementing the method should be enforced in each class.
in this scenario the method can be declared as abstract

implementation 
this can be done using abstract keyword
a method with abstract keyword should provide only method signature , definition even blank definition should not be provided.

in a class when a method is declared as abstract the class also has to be declared as abstract to notify incompleteness.

rules
an abstract method has only declaration of method signature.
accessmodifier abstract returntype methodname(parameters);
the class should be declared with abstract keyword
abstract class Emp{   }
abstract class cannot be instanciated. only reference can be used.
abstract class enforces inheritance. and abstract methods enforces overriding.
the subclass should provide definition of all the abstract methods of the superclass
otherwise that subclass also becomes abstract.
