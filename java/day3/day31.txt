constrcutor
special method in a class that is used to initialize instance variables of the object.

how to define the constructor method?
method signature => return_datatype methodname(parameterlist)
method			void displayEmpInfo()
constructor => 	Emp() //parameterless or default constructor 
		Emp(int en,String enm) //parameterised constructor1
		Emp(int eno,String ename,float sal) // parameterized constructor2
		Emp(String ename,int eno)  // parameterized constructor3

how many constructors?
many constructors cam be written provided the parameter list should be different in either no. of parameters or type of parameters or sequence of parameters
	
it do not have any return type specification
it has same name as class name
it can take parameters
parameterless constrcutor => Emp(){initialization of instance variables for particular object  }
parameterised constructor => Emp(parameters){initialization of instance variables for particular object  }

how to use it or call it?
constructor is always called implicitly when the memory allocation is done for the object with new keyword. it is called only once at the time of instanciation.

Emp e=new Emp();

Emp => classname
e =>object reference of classtype
new => operator use to allocate memory to all instance variables
Emp() => implicit call to the constructor for initialization of all the instance variables for the particular object 


if not a single constructor is provided, then JAVA uses parameterless constructor to initialize all instance variables with default value of respective datatype on its own.
if parameterised constructor is provided then JAVA will not provide dafault constructor , if you want to use it, then it is to be written by the programmer explicitly.

about parameters
if instance variable names and constructor parameter name (i.e. local variable ) is same then always local variable will get precedence. to initialize or refer instance variable keyword this is to be used.
eno=eno; => instance variable eno will not be initialized with passed value.
this.instance var naame=local var / parameter =>this.eno=eno; => this keyword refers to current or invoking object. so it initializes the instance variable eno.



this keyword
** this keyword is used to refer instance variables of invoking or current object.

** this(parametelist) can be used to call one constructor from another provided
it should be the first statement in the calling constrcutor.
the parameter list should match with one of the constructors written
there should not be cyclic reference.
it can be used only within the constructor.

** this keyword can be used to call a method from another method.
it is not mandetory to write it as first statament as in case of constructor
the methodname & parameters should match with some method written in the class
it is not compulsary to use this keyword, but it is always a better practice.

memory management
allocation of memory, releasing the memory
Emp e=new Emp();
e => reference variable 
new Emp() =>  memory will be allocated to all instance variables and initialization of these instance variables will be done using constructor.
e=null;
